ETL project due 12.6 with Anson 

Explore global trust and which countries have the highest trust in their national institutions, broken out over a 100 year time period. Compare, US vs. other super powers and explore further any other factors such as political influences such as pessimism/optimism in a society. Expecting to see US trust levels low and pessimism high. Perhaps edit the optimism/pessimism part if we think of something more correlated or interesting.
Upon researching data sources, US data is much nicer and may be easier to work with, connect with Anson on what he thinks and re-define the description as we see fit.

Response: 
Where is there the most trust in a political system, where is there the lowest? Who has the greatest decrease over a 50 year time period. Look at countries that went through a revolution lol? Explore US trust levels and what social aspects may play a part.
